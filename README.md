# LLM-LLAMA2-META
 I've successfully translated Data Camp's "Fine-Tune Your LLaMA2" webinar into Spanish, presenting an inclusive guide to fine-tuning theory and code. This project delves into both theoretical foundations and the hands-on application, featuring the development of a specialized dataset for practical implementation.  The initiative's goal is to seamlessly integrate theory with hands-on experience, providing a gentle introduction to the nuanced art of fine-tuning.
